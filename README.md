- 👋 Hi, I’m @Git-Bass
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on gaming related projects. But I'm not ready yet. My skill-set isn't strong enough.
- 📫 How to reach me - send me a message on here. I will be online regularly now my studying is in full-swing.
